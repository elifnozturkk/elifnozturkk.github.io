Hello, welcome to my homepage! I am currently a student at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/) with Computer Science & Engineering major and Decision & Behaviour minor. I am a member of [Varol Lab](http://varollab.com/) and working under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com/). My research focuses on group behaviors and temporal dynamics of femicides in Turkey in the aspects of digital activism, traumatization, and emotions.
